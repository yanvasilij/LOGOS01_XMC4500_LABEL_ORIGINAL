/* This linker script is based on the default LSL file.
 * This demonstrates the linker file requirements for the GMM001 app.
 * The GMM001 App uses three memory banks for dynamic memory allocation.
 * Three memory banks are used due to three non-contiguos RAMs in XMC45xx 
 * devices. GMM001 App needs the start address and size of these banks.
 * These values shall be provided by the linker script.
 * The following symbols shall be defined in the linker script.
 * Heap_Bank1_Start, Heap_Bank1_Size (values for Bank1)
 * Heap_Bank2_Start, Heap_Bank2_Size (values for Bank3)
 * Heap_Bank2_Start, Heap_Bank2_Size (values for Bank3)
 * 
 * In this example LSL file, the following strategy is used for 
 * allocating these three different banks
 * 1. DSRAM2 is used completely for Bank2
 * 2. PSRAM is used completely for Bank3
 * 3. DSRAM1 will be used for stack and all remaining RAM requirements.
 * The remaining free memory will be allocated for Bank1.
 * 4. A fixed size stack will be used to maximize the size of Bank1.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: Please always check the map file to ensure all memory
 * allocations are as intended and appropriate for your application.
 *
